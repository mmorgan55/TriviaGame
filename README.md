# TriviaGame Project

### Why I made this app.
* The original concept I had for this game was to be a multiplayer trivia game with the ability to have
many customizable features that could be added from the backend. Unfortunately that was out of scope, but
it gets to the main reason that I wanted to build this game, and that was to really get practice with 
developing databases for applications as that is something I had no knowledge of coming into the bootcamp.
I thought that making a simple game with a more complex backend would be a great way to learn the basics
and use that to help me build a more complex backend for the capstone projects.

* Trivia games are a great way to learn random facts that you might otherwise never learn. In this way, I
think the app would appeal to anyone that likes learning random facts and anyone who would like to learn
in a fun and engaging way.
